Code solving non-linear ODE system describing evolution of dark matter in the early universe.

Program requires 3 matlab files: Boltzmannsolver.m, derivs1.m, derivs2.m.
Boltzmannsolver.m is the main code, derivs1 and derivs2 compute derivatives.
All 3 programs are assumed to be in the same directory.
